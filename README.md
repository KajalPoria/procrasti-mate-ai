# 🚫 ProcrastiMate – The AI That Helps You *Not* Do Things

> Because productivity is overrated.

ProcrastiMate is your personal **AI procrastination assistant** — designed to help you *avoid* being productive, *delay* your goals in style, and *celebrate* your lack of motivation.  
Built for the **Queen’s Stupid Hackathon 2025**, this app proudly takes uselessness to a new level — while still being fully functional and (ironically) well-built.

---

## 💡 Inspiration
While everyone builds AI tools to *increase* productivity, we decided to build one that proudly does the opposite.  
ProcrastiMate was born from the universal struggle of “I’ll start after one more meme.”  
We thought — why fight procrastination when you can **embrace it intelligently**?

---

## 🤖 What It Does
ProcrastiMate helps you:
- Generate **creative excuses** for not doing tasks.
- Activate **Fake Focus Mode** to *pretend* you’re working.
- Receive **AI-generated distractions** (memes, jokes, useless facts).
- Get **demotivational quotes** when you’re feeling *too motivated*.
- Compete with friends in the **Procrastination Leaderboard**.
- Hit the **Emergency Button** to instantly avoid productivity.
- Chat with an **AI mentor** that gives *bad advice only*.
- Track your *Fake Productivity Score* proudly.

- **AI Features:** OpenAI API for generating excuses, quotes, and “useless facts”  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Login  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)
